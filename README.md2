ideas

have a player that can move forward
and look at glowing signs that are on the left and right of the screen
that show all my projects on them

also

have a static website that just shows all my projects for
people with not so good computers since using
three.js 3d graphics might be laggy for them and
ruin the experience


use three.js
use svelte
use tailwind
